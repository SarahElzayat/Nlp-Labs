Q1:

the vocab size of the word embeddings is 243 words


Q2:

the number of dimensions of the word embeddings is 300


Predicted Country:
Egypt

Predicted Similarity:
0.7626820802688599

Q3:

Yes, it is what i expected because the relation between greece and athens is the same relation between egypt and cairo


Q4:

yes make sinse because the range of the cosine similarity is [-1,1] and the similarity is 0.762682,
it is close to 1 so it make sense to be heigh similarity.
it also mean that the similarity between egypt and cairo is close to the similarity between greece and athens
if we follow the relation egypt - cairo = greece - athens , we find that it is logicall to give us heigh similarity between (egypt,cairo) and (greece,greece - athens + cairo)


Computed Accuracy:
0.9192082407594425

Q5:

Yes


Q6:

the plot above illustrate the relation between the words in the list, the words that have the same meaning are close to each other
due to the fact that they have the same context and the words that have different meaning are far from each other

due to Pca we can reduce the dimension of the data to 2 dimensions and plot it to see the relation between the words, the 2 out dimension will be the most important dimensions that have the most variance in the data
